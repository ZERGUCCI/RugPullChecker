# RugPullChecker

I added a tool to a crypto website which utilized BSC scan to allow the user of the tool to input a liquidity pools contract address
and get a score based on the safety of the liquidity pool. It checked who the top holders were, then checked whether they were burn or timelock addresses, then also reported the top 10 holders of the pool. I have only included the javascript here as I dont want to include the entire website of the client publicly. The API keys used have also been changed to TEST. If you want to use it yourself you have to create a bscscan API key and replace 'TEST' with them
